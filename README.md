Get next Line

This project is about getting the next line. It's a function that takes a file as an argument and returns the next line it reads.
If you call it once it will return the first line, if you call it 5 times it will return the first 5 lines or NULL if it reached EOF.
The main part of the project is buffer management with an introduction to static variables. It can be compiled using different buffer sizes and has
to work as long as the size is more than 0. The instructions specify that we cannot just read the entire file and store each line in an array. 
Once the project "works", most of the time spent on the project has been fixing memory leaks and error management. 

Enjoy !
